# Evancio.Becca 0.2
This is a customized template for Becca, the new discord bot.

# instructions for Evancio
Put Becca's token inside:
> token = "token"

Put Becca's id inside:
> cid = "client_id"

(you can get the id by using ?userinfo of Dyno or auserinfo of Arcane.)

I used "bot" variable instead of "client" (i use that on iso6.9, read iso6.9's repo for its code), if you want to use client you can read isobot's original repo.

Its default prefix is `!` and its default command is `!help` and `!echo`.

Remember to change the things in `<>` because its just a placeholder.
